#   Consider dividing a string into two halves.

# Case 1:

# The length is even, the front and back halves are the same length.

# Case 2:

# The length is odd, we'll say that the extra char goes in the front half.



# e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.

# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form :

# (a-front + b-front) + (a-back + b-back)
